      "description": "Develop smaller, lighter web apps that are simple to create and easy to test, extend, and maintain as they grow. This hands-on guide introduces you to AngularJS, the open source JavaScript framework that uses Model–view–controller (MVC) architecture, data binding, client-side templates, and dependency injection to create a much-needed structure for building web apps. Guided by two engineers who worked on AngularJS at Google, you’ll walk through the framework’s key features, and then build a working AngularJS app—from layout to testing, compiling, and debugging. If you have JavaScript experience, you’ll learn how AngularJS helps reduce the complexity of your web app. Dive deep into Angular’s building blocks and learn how they work together Gain maximum flexibility by separating logic, data, and presentation responsibilities with MVC Assemble your full app in the browser, using client-side templates Use AngularJS directives to extend HTML with declarative syntax Communicate with the server and implement simple caching with the $http service Use dependency injection to improve refactoring, testability, and multiple environment design Get code samples for common problems you face in most web apps",

      "description": "Build SEO-friendly, high-performance single-page applications with Angular 2 About This Book Get up to date with the latest changes to Angular 2, including the improvements to directives, change detection, dependency injection, router, and more Understand Angular 2's new component-based architecture Start using TypeScript to supercharge your Angular 2 applications Who This Book Is For Do you want to jump in at the deep end of Angular 2? Or perhaps you're interested assessing the changes before moving over? If so, then Switching to Angular 2 is the book for you. To get the most out of the book, you'll need to be familiar with AngularJS 1.x, and have a good understanding of JavaScript. No knowledge of the changes made to Angular 2 is required follow along. What You Will Learn Understand the changes made from Angular 1.x with side-by-side code samples to help demystify the Angular 2 learning curve Start working with Angular 2's new method of implementing directives Use TypeScript to write modern, powerful Angular 2 applications Dig in to the change-detection method, and other architectural changes to make sure you know what's going on under the hood of Angular 2. Get to work with the new router in Angular 2 Use the new features of Angular 2 including pipes, or the updated features such as forms, services, and the DI module Master server-side rendering in Angular 2 to keep your new applications SEO friendly In Detail AngularJS is a JavaScript framework that makes building web applications easier. It is used today in large-scale, high-traffic websites that struggle with under-performance, portability issues, as well as SEO unfriendliness, and complexity at scale. Angular 2 changes that. It is the modern framework you need to build performant and robust web applications. “Switching to Angular 2” is the quickest way to get to grips with Angular 2 and will help you transition in to the brave new world of Angular 2. We'll start with an overview which sets the changes of the framework in context with version 1.x. After that, you will be taken on a TypeScript crash-course so we can take advantage of Angular 2 in its native, statically-typed environment.
