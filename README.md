# BookCollection

I will be updating this App to use NgRx later **today March 19th**. Implementation of NgRx will use @NgRx/Effects and @NgRx/Entity.  

## Todo:
- When no books in collection should display message "No books in your collection"
- When no search results should display message "No Books Found"
- Sort Options should be a dropdown menu
- Convert into NgRx
- Restyle SearchBox

## Objectives
The app accomplishes the following requirements: 
* [X] Use Angular CLI
* [X] Implement Google Books API
* [X] Built intuitive UX/UI with Material Design
* [X] Use Typescript
* [X] Use Git & GitHub

* [X] Sort Books
* [X] Search Functionality
* [X] Debounce Search
* [X] Clean Code

## Instructions
First install all dependencies with `npm i`.

Then run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
